I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://pphs.usc.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) in the [Department of Population and Public Health Sciences](https://pphs.usc.edu/) at [Keck School of Medicine](https://keck.usc.edu/), [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/). 

Prior to joining USC, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/) in the [Department of Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), and with [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/) from [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/). In 2020, I received my doctoral degree in Biostatistics from the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.ucla.edu) at [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu) (UCLA), under the supervision of [Sudipto Banerjee](http://sudipto.bol.ucla.edu/). I graduated from the [School of Mathematical Science](http://math.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) with a bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics and applied mathematics in 2014.

My research interests include statistical modeling and analysis for geographically referenced data, Bayesian statistics (theory and methods), statistical computing, and related software development.
