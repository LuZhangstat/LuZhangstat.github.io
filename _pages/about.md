I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Department of Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) under the supervision of [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/) and [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/). I received my doctoral degree in Biostatistics from [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.ucla.edu) at [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu) (UCLA) in 2020. My advisor was [Sudipto Banerjee](http://sudipto.bol.ucla.edu/). I graduated from [School of Mathematical Science](http://math.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) with a bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics and applied mathematics in 2014.

My research interests span the topics of statistical modeling and analysis for geographically referenced data, Bayesian statistics (theory and methods), statistical computing and related software development.
